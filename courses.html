    <h1>Training Options</h1>
    <p>Each and everyone of us is individual. We may share values, ideas and enthusiasm but we all have our own identity, beliefs and experiences.

      During my years as a coach, I have always been aware that one training program does not fit all. As a result, I have built a number of training options that provide quality coaching for anyone of any ability.
      
      These options include face to face meetings, virtual training, training incognito and long- term training. During my career I have worked with people of all ages and backgrounds so all the programs are very easy to understand and apply.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="courses-box">
    <h2>Face to Face</h2>
    <p>If you are based on the Isle of Wight, I can visit you in person so we can discuss your current situation, challenges you are facing and your desired outcome. I will design a program specifically for you that includes a variety of easy to implement techniques. Some will provide an instant impact whilst others require a dedicated period of practise time. Each session will be packed with high quality information so after every meeting I provide an audio summary of our session.</p>
  <span class="courses-cost">Cost: £80.00 per session. (Approx. 60-80mins)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="courses-box"><h2>Virtual Training</h2>
  <p>Our perceptions of Video calls have changed significantly and are now widely accepted as an effective alternative to face-to-face conversations. I personally use zoom, WhatsApp or messenger. All are high quality and provide a platform for us to build a team relationship no matter where you are in the World. Each session will provide the same high-quality information as the face-to-face meetings so at the end of our session I provide an audio summary.</p>
  <span class="courses-cost">Cost: £80.00 per session. (Approx. 60-80mins)</span>
  </div>


  <div class="courses-box" id="training-incognito-box">

    <h2>Training Incognito</h2>
    <p>The thought of a face to face or video interaction for some is very uncomfortable. Although the desire to learn and master psychological techniques is high on their list, they don’t want to talk to anyone directly or simply wish to remain anonymous.

      Training incognito provides the same high quality as face to face and virtual training without the verbal conversation. We simply converse through text or email where the client explains the challenges they are facing. I design and record a video coaching session specifically for them. We continue to remain in contact through text or email to ensure sufficient progress is being made.</p>
      <span class="courses-cost" id="training-incognito-cost">Cost: £80.00 per video. (Approx. 45mins)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="courses-box">
    <h2>Long Term Program</h2>
    <p>For those who wish to invest in a long-term program I have developed a course that provides a comprehensive program over a period of five months. The training is delivered face to face, a live call or personalised recorded video. I teach a system that delivers everything required to develop the ultimate mindset that will be crucial in a forever changing competitive sporting arena. The ability to consciously produce a state of mind that provides self-certainty, desire and focus no matter what the occasion or the environment is the sports persons “super power”. The program is completely life changing. Instead of simply pursuing your goals and dreams you become the person who is equipped to achieve them. <br><br>

      The course includes two intensive coaching sessions per month and two 15-minute phone calls for feedback and to address any challenges. We can also text or email as an alternative to a phone call.
    </p>
    <span class="courses-cost">Cost: £149 per month.</span>
