          <p class="about-me-text" id="first-about-paragraph">There is a common belief that elite sports performers have a natural gift to remain
            calm and focused during high pressure situations, a gift that can’t be learnt. This view is common but
            completely false. I agree that some competitors are naturally more focused than others however anyone can
            learn to remain focused and certain in extremely challenging situations. </p>

            <p class="about-me-text"> Have you ever felt incredibly confident and asked yourself why? Your search for
              the answer probably came from an external source. You may have won a recent match or tournament. Maybe
              your current performances are of a high standard. When you experience anxiety and apprehension it can
              feel that infinite catastrophes are inevitable however when you feel confident the competitive arena can
              be a place to push hard, thrive, grow and of course perform to your very best. Therefore, the challenge 
              s a familiar one. We need to feel confident to perform well but we need to perform well to build confidence.
              My work is centred around the ability to create a psychological state that is appropriate to the situation
              you face. You may require an intense state of certainty or remain calm and relaxed. When you master the
              ability to consciously generate a state of mind you will then understand why I call it the sports
              competitor’s super power. </p>

              <p class="about-me-text" id="last-about-paragraph">In a nutshell you produce a state of confidence, certainty, focus or composure and
                project that onto the external world so your environment now looks and feels very different.  Instead of
                the competitive challenge and environment defining your state you create an appropriate one consciously.</p>
